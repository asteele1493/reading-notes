        <h2>These are questions I've asked my dog today.</h2>
        <p1>Imagine-- waking up to a sunlit room. Birds are chirping. You think to yourself, <strong> gasp </strong> I think I deserve a latte.
            You do your hair, gather your keys, and a sad pup looks up at you wondering if she'll go too.</p1>
        
            <br>

        <p2>These prompts are a reenactment of my coffee run this morning. Please note, there are literally questions I asked my dog.</p2>

        <br>
        
        <p3 style="color:red;"> Question 1: Do you want to go on a car ride?</p3>

        <br>

        <p4 style="color: aqua;"> Question 2: Was that a hiccup?</p4>
        <br>

        <p5 style="color: blueviolet;"> Question 3: Wait... did you just throw up in the car?</p5>
        <br>
        <p6 style="color: brown;"> Question 4: Do you still deserve a treat?</p6>
        <br>
    </body>

         console.log('The first prompt describes how I set myself up for failure.');
         console.log('I literally knew my dog gets carsick, but here we are.');
         console.log('Again, knew this. Did it. We are here. At least she did it outside... on the publicc sidewalk.');
         console.log('Listen. You can't blame me. She's damn cute.');
            let prompt_first = prompt("Do you want to go on a car ride?");
        
             // string concatenation
            alert("You answered: " + prompt_first);

             //string interpolation
            alert("Okay, okay, but only if you can handle it.");

            let prompt_second = prompt("Was that a hiccup?");

            alert("You answered: " + prompt_second);

            alert("Okay... I guess we'll keep driving. We're almost to the coffee shop anyway.");

            let prompt_third = prompt("Wait... did you just throw up in the car?");

            alert("You answered: " + prompt_third);

            alert("Are you serious?");
            
            let prompt_fourth = prompt("Do you still deserve a treat?");

            alert("You answered: " + prompt_fourth);

            alert("Of course you do. :)" );
