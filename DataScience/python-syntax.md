# Python Tutorial, Getting Started

Using [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/colinmorris/hello-python), I am hoping to delve more into learning Python. These are my notes based off of the tutorial.

- You don't need to declare a variable before assigning to it. Assigning and reassigning can happen without any type of const or let.

- ```print``` is a built in Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen.

An example of this would be: 

INPUT: ```print('hello, world')```
OUTPUT: ```hello, world```

- A colon indicates a new line in a code block. 

An example of this would be: 

```python
if 1 < 0:

      print('of course it is!')
      
```

Strings can be in single or double quotes.

Min, max, and abs are all available as built in methods as well. 

``` python

#INPUT:
print(min(1, 2, 3))
print(max(1, 2, 3))
print(abs(32))
print(abs(-32))

#OUTPUT
1
3
32
32

```
