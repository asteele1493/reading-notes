# Python tutorial - Functions & Getting Help

```python
help()
```

This is rad - I wonder if Javascript has something like this built in. Something I realize I could be stronger in is remembering exact syntax for built in functions. Oftentimes, I know what method I ***want*** to use, but am unsure of the syntax. This would have saved me so much time in solving code challenges (insert crying emoji here).

- Something to note: you must pass in the name of the function as an argument for```help()```.

## Defining functions

Defining a function begins with using the ```def``` keyword followed by the function name and it's corresponding arguments and a colon indicating a new line of code. 

- For my own understanding, you can liken the colon to a curly brace in Javascript. 

Once the function logic has been written, you would return just as you would a function in Javascript. If you do ***not*** return, you will receive ```none``` or undefined.

### Docstrings

Docstrings are descriptions of what is happening in the code. Syntactically, a dosctring is represented by triple quotes.

#### Functions Applied to Functions

Functions that operate on other functions are called higher order functions.
