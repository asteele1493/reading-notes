## Ordered list element

- <ol> and <ul> representing list of items.
Ordered lists have meaning/and order.

- You can set lists in html to have specific types such as all lowercase, all uppercase, Roman numerals, or numbers.

- Using the start attribute will dictate where in the ordered list you should begin to list.

## Unordered lists are typically in bullet points unless otherwise styled.

- Both styles of lists can be nested as much as you’d like. The main difference between the two is that ordered lists have meaning behind them and unordered lists do not.

## Box Model

### Block boxes vs. inline boxes. 

### Block boxes feature these characteristics: 
- They will break into a new line
- The width and height properties are respected
- Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away
- The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container
Inline boxes feature these characteristics: 
- The box will not break into a new line
- The width and height properties won’t apply
- Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but won’t cause other inline boxes to move 
- Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away

*** Noting these differences from [MDN web docs] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) *** 

## I noted the differences between boxes above because I still feel pretty shaky on the box model concept. I understand the parts of the box, and their importance, but the block vs. inline boxes are confusing to me.

That said, I understand what a box model is comprised of and understand how to view it in a web console.

- Something else I want to revisit are the general structure of an array in JS.
- I see that the pop technique is also present in JS. Wondering if deques and queues are also present.
- I’d like to learn more about the split technique.

### Arrays

Arrays are lists that store data under a variable name. They’re efficient. If we didn’t have arrays, we’d have to store information individually in variables.


### Expressions and operators

Binary vs. unary operators
- Binary operator requires two operands, one before and one after the operator. 
- Unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.

Four types of an HTML elements box: 
Content box: Area where content is displayed.
Padding box: Padding sits around the content as white space
Border box: Wraps the content and any padding
Margin box: Outermost layer; wraps the other three items as whitespace b/t the box and other elements 

What are margin and padding?
Margin is invisible space around your box. Use margin properties.

Padding— sits b/t the border and the content. Used to push the content away from the border.Cannot have negative padding.

### Javascript arrays

- You can store strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays in arrays. Arrays are flexible.
- Array inside of another array— multidimensional array.

Adding items variable.push(‘added _item’);

Removing items variable.pop();

### Loops

Iterative blocks of code.
