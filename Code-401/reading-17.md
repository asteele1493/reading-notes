# AWS S3 & Lambda

[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

**What is Amazon S3?**

- S3 is an AWS service that stores objects. S3 lends itself to effectively scaling, data availability, security, and performance. At it's core, S3 stores and protects data for virtually any use case.

**Name some use cases for Amazon S3.**

- AI data analytics, archiving data, applications that consider scaling and need to configure settings to accomodate.

**Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.**

- Low cost, secure, applicable to most use cases.

[AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

**What is AWS Lambda?**

- AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that takes user-created functions and self-contained applications, and runs them efficiently.

**Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.**

- Automating tasks such as jobs that need to get done within your infrastructure, processing data from forms, or moving data around

- Scalable API's

- Data processing/event-based data processing

**Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.**

- Serverless just means you won't need to worry about maintaining a server yourself. Worrying about computational processes, storage, memory. That entire part of the process will be handled by Lambda so all you'll have to do is write the actual code it needs to run.

**What is a CDN?**

- CDN, or a Content Delivery Network, is a group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of the internet. CDN handles data transfer.

**How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?**

- The CDNs closest to the user will handle the data transfer by redirecting the original request from the site's server to the server closest to the user.

**What are the benefits of employing a CDN?**

- Using a CDN helps prevent cyber attacks because CDN's handle more traffic and can withstand hardware failure better than most origin servers.
