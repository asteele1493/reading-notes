# Ethics in Tech

## Code of Ethics

- "All people are stakeholders in computing."
- "Consider whether the results of their efforst will redspect diversity... and be used in socially responsible ways... be broadly accessible."
- Intent vs. impact -- well intention can be outweighed by harm.
- "leaders should ensure that opportunities are available to computing professionals to help them imrpove their knowledge an dskills in professionalism, ethics... technical specialties..."
- The future of computing depends on both technical and ethical excellence.

## Ethics in the Workplace

[Amazon & Facial Recognition](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-workers-demand-jeff-bezos-cancel-face-recognitio-1827037509)

- This was a fascinating read, especially after reviewing the code of ethics readings. Before my pivot into tech, and my time kitchens for that matter, I thought I wanted to go into law. Specifically immigration law. I worked as a paralegal and spent a few years translating testimonies of refugees for court proceedings. I'm also first generation, and spent a lot of my childhood translating for my family and listening to their stories of migration. Now, reading this, it's absolutely wild to me that we have such technology-- targeted facial recognition. I think what gets me is knowing how the system in place targets those who may not know the language, are people of color, or are in active migration. Although the software may be doing what it's meant to do, it can be used to harm others. In the letter quoted in the reading, the workers demanded increased transparency and accountability-- one of the tenets of code ethics previously mentioned. I can appreciate how transparency, accountability, and intent are all principles we learn more about in Code Fellows. Knowing these values are imperative to our development as software engineers makes me feel grateful to be making the career move. Because although I ultimately want to feel financially and professionally stable, I also want to do work that supports communities and betters the lives of others in some way.

## Ethics in Technology

[Ethical dilemmas of self driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)

- I feel like AI chatbots have had a lot of press over the last several months with chatgpt, but it's really interesting to see other AI-powered technologies emerge as we learn more about what AI can actually do. Thinking about the minimization of harm and what that actually amounts to in regards to self-driving cars feels murky. The globe article applies some of the same ethical standards mentioned in the code ethics documents-- self driving cars should minimize death, minimize harm. The dissonent connection I have is with applying intent versus impact to an AI powered object. Can you appropriately hold such thing to a standard? I can also understand the hesitancy I have can be likened to the hesitancy most people experienced when cell phones emerged, but cell phones also didn't physically harm people in the same way? The thought of human control is also a weird thing for me to wrap my head around.
