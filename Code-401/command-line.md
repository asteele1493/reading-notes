# The command line

## The Command Line

- Goes over basic syntax when interacting with the command line. (i.e. general prompt user@bash, where arguments live, what output looks like)

- Learned more about shells which was cool-- I've seen the term used widely, but learning what it actually is/the different kinds of shells is interesting. I had to go through this when deciphering bash vs. zsh and why my terminal was looking funky earlier this week. (i.e. echo $SHELL)

## Basic Navigation

- Learned about basic commands aka things like pwd, ls, cd, la, and relative paths. Learned more about shortcuts as well. Primarily talking about the tilde as a home button of sorts. I am very familiar with the . and .. operatinos.

## More About Files

- Learned that everything is a file (what a meta concept tbh)!

- File extensions are something I'm still fuzzy on, so differentiating between .exe, .txt, and .png is helpful.

- It was good revisiting why spaces in names are tricky.

- Accessing hidden files! aka ls -la

## Manual Pages

- Manual pages are pages that explain every command available on your system including the specifics of how you run them and what arguments they accept. Almost feels like a documentation-adjacent type concept.

- Learned how to look up the manual page for a command which I've found helpful in the last week.

- Really into the term search syntax as well as the next operation.

## File Manipulation

- This section started off by teaching how to make a directory in the terminal aka mkdir.

- Extending on that concept, learning how to create parent directories using the -p operator.

- I think being able to create a blank file is nifty and didn't know you could do that with a terminal.

- As an aside, had some practice copying files with David this week when sorting out my zsh shell. I feel very green when it comes to all of these shortcuts, it's really cool being able to put them into practice.

## Cheat Sheet

- Not really a note as this seciton is fairly self explanatory, but as an aside, this is going to be a highly referenced bookmark in my browser, I can already tell.
