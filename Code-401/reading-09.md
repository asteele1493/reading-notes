# Authentication & Authorization Project Ideas

These ideas absolutely need to be refined, but here are some rough thoughts for the final project:

- Newsroom: Small local newspaper with subscription model. Only subscribers are able to read content, writers can write but cannot delete stories, and admins can modify anything. Subscribers can also save their favorite headlines to read later.

- Food delivery service: If you are a user in the service you are able to place orders for food as well as save your favorites. Restaurants are able to modify orders based on availability. 

- I also really like the pet rescue idea.
