- We worship ourselves. Drawn to nature because it's an escape from humans.

- Success: we think we know what it means. You can't be successful at everything. Every vision of success needs to recognize what it's losing out on.

- Our ideas of what it means to be successful are not our own. They are repurposed from hugely powerful forces.

- We should make sure our ideas of success are truly what we want/our own.
