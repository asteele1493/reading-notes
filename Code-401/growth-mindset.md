- Deliberate practice is the exercise of doing hard things. It is the intention behind practicing the hard stuff-- pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone to learn how to solve more complex problems.

- The idea that you are actively developing a skill is a powerful perspective. Moreso than the idea that failure is imminent.

- Fixed mindset causes the stagnation of creativity.

- Growth mindset causes active creativity.

- Significant predictor of success is grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals.

- Long term commitment.

- Teaching a solid work ethic-- talent doesn't give you grit. Growth mindset gives you grit. The belief that the ability to learn is not fixed.

- We worship ourselves. Drawn to nature because it's an escape from humans.

- Success: we think we know what it means. You can't be successful at everything. Every vision of success needs to recognize what it's losing out on.

- Our ideas of what it means to be successful are not our own. They are repurposed from hugely powerful forces.

- We should make sure our ideas of success are truly what we want/our own.

[Assess Emotional Intelligence](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.html)

- My score for this assessment remained about the same. I know I am a very emotional person and tend to observe and absorb emotions from others easily. I scored lowest in the relationship management area and I feel like it's mostly due to my taking things too personally. I really enjoy working with others and find that I can overthink social situations. Learning to unlearn this more and more with each course.

[Assess Biases](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html)

- My score indicated a high self awareness. I hold many identities that inform the way I perceive and carry myself in spaces. My lowest scoring area remained the effective courage portion. It can be difficult to confront bias when you are concerned for personal/group safety. I think about this a lot.
