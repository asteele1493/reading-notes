## Discussion Questions

- What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- One of the skills I believe I excel in are my communication skills— in hospitality, your job centers being able to read and understand people, in addition to the ability to communicate effectively with them. It’s an industry grounded in creativity and innovation that requires you to explain the way you conceptualize food. This unique experience and skillset I have honed as a chef has equipped me with the skills I believe will make me a standout candidate. 

- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. The first thing I plan on doing is something that was the core of the Super Mario Effect video. Emphasizing the goal rather than the failure in programming. It’s easy to get down on yourself for failing, but if you visualize the program as a game, a level to be defeated, it helps put coding in perspective.

2. Another aspect I think will be helpful in getting unstuck is in the “How to Think Like a Programmer” article. More specifically, spending more time in figuring out what the actual problem is before jumping in to coding.

3. Finally, the first article really resonated with me and is something I already try and do when I'm feeling stuck. Mostly referring to putting a high value on my time. This rings especially true when working a full time job in addition to being in a bootcamp. My time is incredibly limited, and I do my best to make sure the time I spend is focused, productive time. It's a good reminder.
