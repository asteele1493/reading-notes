# Node Ecosystem

[An Introduction to Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**

- Node is essentially running Javascript in your browser.

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**

- Runtime designates the instructions that are executed by your machine. So knowing that Node is a Javascript runtime delineates Node as using Javascript to run.

**What is Node used for?**

- Node is used to build web applications. Node is also used to run Javascript on a server.

## Things I want to know more about/supplemental notes

- Node.js is single-threaded and event driven.

**Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**

- I'm really excited to get back into API's. Also excited to learn more about linked lists and Big O!

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**

- I feel like this is the sentiment I have when starting any new Code Fellows class, but my primary learning goal is to be as intentional as I can with my learning and understanding of class material. Especially after reviewing the growth mindset readings-- I know this class is the (very long) home stretch. Wanting to make sure I stay diligent in understanding the material.
