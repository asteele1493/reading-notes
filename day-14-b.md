- Honestly, the beginning of this article started to stress me out. I love working in groups, but when it's not good, it's really not good. I do agree with some of the statistics though-- I do feel like I'm more confident and have better outcomes when working with a solid group.
- Understanding group norms, I'd agree, is crucial to making a group dynamic work. 
- Two behaviors the researchers noticed both groups shared: Members spoke in roughly the same proportion i.e. "Equality in distribution of conversation turn-taking." Collective intelligence declines when not everyone speaks and only a few people get the mic. Second behavior is that all members had a high "average social sensitivity". They could tell how others were feeling. This is a trait I feel like I'm very sensitive to. 
- "Success is built on experiences."
