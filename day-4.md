# Class 4 notes: HTML Links, CSS layout, JS functions

## HTML links- these are web features that allow us to give functionality to web pages. Linking to documents, images, resources, and other media forms.

- Links are made using anchor tags and href attributes. 

Ex. Syntax
 `<p>` My favorite website is
`<a href=“https://www.codefellows.org/“>`Code Fellows`</a>`.
`</p>` 

- Links are wrapped up inside of `<a>` tags. The href contains the URL of what you’re linking to.

- Adding titles to your links can give the user more information about what exactly you are linking to.

* URL - Uniform Resource Locator
A URL defines exactly where in the World Wide Web a webpage lives. The URL utilizes paths, much like your local computer to link to a page.

* Document fragments - Still a little fuzzy on what document fragments actually are; I think they’re ways to link specific pieces of a document in your html code? 

- Ways to make links accessible are to use intentional keywords. It’s easy for a screen reader to jump around on the page, but providing context for what the link is intended for can make the content more accessible.

## Things I want to know more about

- I really want to learn more about nav bars/menus. I think it’d be a cool way to add functionality to my page.
- Is normal flow related in any way to our reset.css page in our project directory?
- What exactly is object oriented programming? Are they related to methods at all?
- Absolute v. fixed positioning. 

# Normal flow in CSS

- Normal flow is how web pages are structured without any modification from CSS style pages.
- Difference b/t block level and in-line level elements: 
    - Block level: “the block level’s content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension.”
    - Inline level: “The size of the inline element is the size of their content.Cannot set width or height.”
    - [MDN page on normal flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)
- Absolute positioning and fixed positioning are very similar. Having trouble understanding why.

# Functions- Reusable blocks of code

- Functions are pieces of code stored in a defined block. You can call the block of code when you want to execute the block of code; helpful to prevent redundancy.
- JS already has many built-in functions. 
    - Function invocation: Another way of saying running the block of code. 
    - Function declaration: Similar to declaring a variable? The first instance a function is detailed?
- Functions v. Methods
    - Are methods a part of a function?

- Some functions require parameters to be called.
    - Parameters are also called arguments! or Properties. Or Attributes.
