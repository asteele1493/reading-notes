**What is functional programming?**

- To my understanding, functional programming is a style of building software. The style looks at computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

- It's a fundamental part of learning to program. One of the first things we learn. We know a function is pure if it returns the same result if given the same arguments, and if it doesn't cause any observable side effects.

**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

- They're easier to read and implement.

**What is immutability?**

- Immutability is unchanging over time or unable to be changed. It's something that can't change after it's been created.

**What is Referential transparency?**

- It's when a function consistently yields the same result for the same input. Pure functions + immutable data are what make up referential transparency.

**What is a module?**

- A module is a bit of code that has specific types of functionality. It's another Javascript file.

**What does the word ‘require’ do?**

- Require is a function that has global scope in Node.js. The string that is passed through is the path we want to include in the module.

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

- We would use the export key, I think.
