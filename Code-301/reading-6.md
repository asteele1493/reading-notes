# NODE.JS

[An Introduction to Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

**What is node.js?**

- Node.js is essentially Javascript in a browser. It works by utilizing a Javascript engine on Chromium-based browsers.

**In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

- Good question lol. It's an engine that is able to take in JS code and execute it on a computer. 

**What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

- It means that the instructions your computer is following/executing/reading is written in Javascript. 

**What is npm?**

- Node package manager! It is a bundle of files that includes node.js (I think). I didn't piece the two together until reading this article. I thought node was an entirely different system/language I'd have to learn how to use.

**What version of node are you running on your machine?**

- v18.9.0

**What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

- 8.19.1

**What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

- npm install -g jshint

**What is node used for?**

- In short, to run JS on a server. Still trying to understand what single-threaded fully means.

[6 Reasons for pair programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

- Greater efficiency, Engaged collaboration, Learning from fellow students, Social skills, job interview readiness, work environment readiness

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

- Probably the second and third benefits. I can sometimes be a little scatterbrained, lots of thoughts and ideas and sometimes I struggle with getting them out. I also feel like I'm very solution-oriented. Pair programming keeps me engaged and continuously learning from and with my peers because I'm forced to talk about my ideas in a more structured way.

**How does pair programming work?**

- I feel like you'd usually have a driver and a navigator. Someone to talk through code and another person to edit. I also know folks who edit and work on code simultaneously. It's essentially a way for two or more brains to work on a piece of code-- come to solutions, work through tough bits, and discuss concepts.
