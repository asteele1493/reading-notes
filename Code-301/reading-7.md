# REST

[How I Explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

- He is the computer scientist that created REST architecture-- pioneered the thinking behind how th einternet works/how servers work.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

- Because some of the techniques that developed later didn't have the requirements needed to talk to every other machine in the world. URL's contain everything you need to retrieve and share data across the internet. The address specifies everything the other machine/server needs to know.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

- HTTP protocol is a group of methods used to do various things with the resources on the internet. It is comprised of GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, and PUT. These actions can do various things with data like retrieve it, delete it, modify, partially modify and update.

**What does a GET do?**

- Retrieves data from another computer. It brings you resources that you request (or the client requests).

**What does a POST do?**

- POST adds specific types of information to a server.

**What does PUT do?**

- PUT completely replaces something in a system.

**What does PATCH do?**

- PATCH does a partial modification to a system.
