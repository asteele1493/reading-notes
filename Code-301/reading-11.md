# Mongo and Mongoose

[NOSQL vs. SQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

1. NOSQL is a non-relational database whereas SQL databases are considered relational.

2. NOSQL databases have dynamic schema while SQL databases have predetermined schema.

3. NOSQL databases are horizontally scalable whereas SQL databases are vertically scalable.

4. In NOSQL databases, queries are focused on collection of documents whereas in SQL databases, you query using SQL or Structured Query Language.

5. NOSQL databases are better fits for hierarchical data storage. SQL databases are not the best fit.

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

- Data that is implemented in heavy-duty transactional type applications.

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

- NOSQL databases are preferred for big data sets.

**Give a real world example.**

- The article lists HBase as an example of this.

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

- NOSQL

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

- SQL

**What does SQL stand for?**

- Structured Query Language!

**What is a relational database?**

- A relational database is a database that stores information that relates to other points of data within itself... I don't know if that makes sense.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

- Tables? Not sure I understand this question.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

- A schema defines how data is organized within a database.

**What is a NoSQL database?**

- A NOSQL database is a non tabular database that provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data. In short, a non relational database.

**How does it work?**

- It stores data in a dynamic way, using flexible schema.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

- Collections of documents.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

- MongoDB, I think. NOSQL databases offer more flexibility and efficiency.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

- It doesn't scale as well/it's not designed to scale on it's own.
