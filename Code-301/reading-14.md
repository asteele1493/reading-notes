# Diversity & Inclusion in the tech industry

[That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

**What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**

- PC's had begun making their way into homes in significant numbers.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

- As computers made their way into American homes, being good with computers wove it's way into the binary narrative of developing boys. Personally, I had always been interested in computers-- my parents still barely know how to use one, but my older brother bought our first family computer when I was seven. I had dabbled with coding, but was stuck in this idea that I was only good at the arts, english, literature, writing-- this idea was reinforced by my parents and teachers. I still have a lot of insecurities working in tech spaces because of this.

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**

- The article mentions that diversity efforts are most successful when there's a commitment from company leaders. I think I'd agree with that.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**

- I feel like the simple answer to this lies in the fact that fostering a community that is wholly homogenous just won't yield as good results. If you're hiring from the same pool, you'd have to assume that the ideas will be similar-- the backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, experience, privilege will all be similar if not the same. Progress and creativity doesn't grow nearly as fast in those types of environments... I think.

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

- The first thing that comes to mind is to hire queer people. Hire latinx people. Hire black people. Hire trans people. Looking at the employment data mentioned previously, all of the underrepresented groups should be higher. I personally don't think companies can serve as broad of a user base if they're not willing to hire those people. Of course, tokenizing is another conversation topic, but I think that's a good start.
